Hey, I am Jubin Ayoob. A Front-end Developer/React Developer from India who loves to design and code. I use React.js or Next.js to build the web application interfaces and the functionalities.

I started to learn about web development through many video tutorials, documentations and articles. The first programming language I learned was C++. I also played around with databases, but MongoDb is my favorite right now.

If you were to ask me what stack I would prefer, I would say

- Framework - Next.js
- Database : MongoDb
- Ui - ChakraUi

You can do anything you can think of with these three things. Next.js is an open-source web development framework built on top of Node.js enabling React-based web applications functionalities such as server-side rendering and generating static websites.

I love my work and enjoy each and every project as I get it. Feel free to look at my portfolio and don't hesitate to contact me.
